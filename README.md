# simple-stackless-lisp

Interpreter for a simple Clojure-like Lisp.

Made stackless using [Lisperator's technique](https://lisperator.net/pltut/cps-evaluator/).

Has first class support for continuations and macros.

See [code examples](resources/).

## Example

```clojure
(def fact
  (fn [n]
    (if (< n 2)
      1
      (* n (fact (- n 1))))))

(println "(fact 50000) =>" (fact 50000))
```

## Usage

### Clone the project

```
$ git clone https://github.com/divs1210/simple-stackless-lisp.git

$ cd simple-stackless-lisp
```

### I. Quickstart

Run the interpreter via Leiningen.

Leiningen is very conveinient, but slow to start.

#### Start a REPL

```
$ rlwrap lein run
```

#### Run a file

```
$ lein run resources/fact.sclj
```

### II. Build native binary

Requires GraalVM and its native-image tool to be installed.

```
$ lein native-image
```

#### Start a REPL

```
$ rlwrap target/default+native-image/sclj
```

#### Run a file

```
$ target/default+native-image/sclj resources/fact.sclj
```
